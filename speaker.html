                    <h3>Aaron Irizarry</h3>
                <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
                <p>
                    Workplace culture doesn’t start with 
                    beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer 
                    fridge, and it doesn’t end with 
                    neckties, PCs, or big corporations. 
                    It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, 
                    beliefs, and the motivations that 
                    enable good work to get done, or it’s 
                    what stifles a workforce. For design 
                    to be most effective and for 
                    designers to feel valued, we need to 
                    work in a culture that embraces 
                    design and allows it to succeed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore 
                    how to recognize the traits of 
                    organizations that *get* design,
                     both large and small. He will share 
                     what those teams, departments, 
                     and companies have that others 
                     don’t, and more importantly, how 
                     to begin to change your own 
                     workplace’s culture. Once you’ve 
                     worked within a culture of design 
                     it’s almost impossible to imagine 
                     yourself anywhere else.
                </p>

                     his thoughts and presentations on

                <h3>Adam Connor</h3>
                <h4>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h4>
                <p>
                    Films succeed in evoking responses 
                    and engaging audiences only with a 
                    combination of well-written narrative 
                    and effective storytelling technique. 
                    It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this 
                    together. To do so they’ve developed 
                    processes, tools and techniques that 
                    allow them to focus attention, 
                    emphasize information, foreshadow 
                    and produce the many elements that 
                    together comprise a well-told story.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the 
                    topic of using stories in design and 
                    expand on the technical aspects used 
                    in film to communicate. We’ll look 
                    at some tools used in film, such as 
                    cinematic patterns, beat sheets, 
                    and storyboards. We’ll consider why 
                    they’re used and how we might look 
                    to them for inspiration.

                <span>ABOUT ADAM</span>
                <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator 
                    and speaker passionate about 
                    collaboration, communication, 
                    creativity and storytelling. As an 
                    Experience Design Director with 
                    Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of 
                    experience in interaction and 
                    experience design with a background 
                    in computer science, film, and 
                    animation to create effective and 
                    easy-to-use digital products and 
                    services. He believes that no matter 
                    how utilitarian a tool is, at the 
                    core of its creation lies a story; 
                    uncovering that story is key to its 
                    success. Occasionally, he shares his 
                    perspectives on design at

                        JavaScript applications frequently

                         js and more, but how can we be 
                         sure that our code is ready for 
                         production? This talk will share 
                         tips on how writing tests can be

                    <h4>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h4>
                    <p>
                        Static wireframes are a drag on 
                        the whole design process. 
                        Prototyping makes things a little 
                        better by allowing you to stitch 
                        together static wireframes or 
                        mockups while adding basic 
                        interactions. Rapid prototyping 
                        with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        is even better and faster; it 
                        increases collaboration and 
                        improves the iteration process. 
                        Kill your wireframes. Long live 
                        rapid prototyping.
